# Orthogonal-Matching-Pursuit
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is an algorithm used for sparse signal recovery in signal processing and compressive sensing applications. It is particularly useful when the signal of interest can be represented as a linear combination of a few elements from an overcomplete dictionary.
